        <p> First of all , I want to thank you mr. Tom Butler for giving a impeccable teaching.
            From this module , I learn a lot of things from the area of computers. The first thing that I observed is the high level of attention and concentration yourself to clearely understand the given information. Next , I want to say that this course gave me a different type of thinking regarding to school. This course learned me that I don't need to be sad or upset because I can't finish a exercise . This course learned me that I need to revision and read again everything with high carefully and  every code problem will be resolved
        </p>
        <p>I was having a lot of downs at the begining because comming from a different highschool course , it was hard for me to understand how some things works. For example when I observe that in the Html are so many numbers and characters , I was so confused . In my mind was like a big boom when I saw how you can creeate functions , how you can design and how you can make a debugging process. The moment when I realise how many things you can do with a computer was special for me . When I realise that I can make a red ball that is moving on the screen I was so excited . When I change the color of the ball in CSS I felt like a artist . After this points I started to practice more and more till I get some good knowledge in html and css . </p>
        <p>About the design part from css , I was really excited to practice more . My favorite colors are green and purple and regarding of this , I combine my tastes with the css . In a significant part of my self practice in css I have used green and purple. Moreover , I feel like a painter when I open the css . Right now , Web Development is my favourite module and this is just because of Tom . He have good skills in communication with the students and he answer me every time I asked him a question. </p>
        <p>I can't wait the next sessions at the Web Developing module . I want to learn more things about the web pages and how I can design them . I want to make more practice and have better skills for developing good solutions for the problems.</p>
